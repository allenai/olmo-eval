"""Uploader service account key for Beaker jobs.

Beaker jobs upload results to the dashboard's ingest service as the shared
``olmo-eval-uploader`` service account. The account has no Google Cloud roles; the
ingest service allowlists it. Its key lives in Secret Manager (managed by
infra/terraform/uploader.tf), and any @allenai.org account can read it.

At launch, the key is read with the launching user's local credentials and written
to a shared Beaker secret in the job's workspace, so personal credentials never
reach Beaker. The secret is rewritten when the key rotates.
