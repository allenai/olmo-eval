"""HELMET RAG (KILT) data loading.

Ports HELMET's `load_qa` (https://github.com/princeton-nlp/HELMET, data.py):
an open-domain question plus a stack of retrieved Wikipedia passages, where the
model must answer from the passages.

Context length is set primarily by how many passages were retrieved, so each
length tier is a separate pre-retrieved file. The retrieved passages
overshoot the tier's budget, though, and HELMET relies on trimming the end of
the passage block at inference time (`tokenize` in its model_utils.py); that
trim is reproduced here with the same fixed reference tokenizer the other
long-context loaders use, so the prompt a model sees is independent of its own
tokenizer. That retrieval was run
once by the HELMET authors and is re-hosted unpacked on `allenai/helmet-plus`;
see `kilt/manifest.json` there for the tier -> file mapping. These files are
large (the 128k tiers are 1-3 GB each) but are cached by huggingface_hub after
the first download.

Because retrieval depth is fixed in the data, these tasks cannot be extended
past standard HELMET's 128k the way the synthetic recall task can.

**`max_samples` caps questions, not instances.** Each question appears several
times in these files with the gold passage planted at different relative
depths -- 6 for nq/triviaqa/popqa (the `dep6` in the filenames: 0.0, 0.2, 0.4,
0.6, 0.8, 0.95) and 3 for hotpotqa -- so the score averages over where in the
context the answer sits, which is the "lost in the middle" effect these tasks
exist to measure. HELMET samples by question and keeps every depth for the
questions it picks, and that is reproduced here: a limit of 100 yields ~600
instances for nq, not 100. Budget accordingly at the longer tiers.
