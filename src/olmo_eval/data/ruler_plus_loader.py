"""HuggingFace-backed data loading for the RULER-plus (ruler-plus) dataset.

Unlike ruler_loader.py's tarball-based RULER release, ruler-plus is generated
with https://github.com/jopetty/RULER (scripts/generate-data.sh, at commit
7512d2416ac7a966bd817ae89a443001aa442f20) and published to the
allenai/ruler-plus HuggingFace dataset repo. Each (context_size, task)
condition is its own JSONL shard, some of which are many GB (contexts run up
to 2097152 tokens), so only the single shard a task actually needs is
downloaded (rather than the whole repo), and it is read with reservoir
sampling so peak memory scales with the requested sample count rather than
the shard's full size.
