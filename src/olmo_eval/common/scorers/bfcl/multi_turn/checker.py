"""Grade a BFCL multi-turn rollout against its ground truth path.

A turn is right when the model left the involved instances in the state the
ground truth path leaves them in, and when everything the ground truth's calls
returned also came back from the model's. Nothing the model said is read.

The response comparison is unordered and cumulative: many turns can be carried
out in more than one order, and a model that fetched something in an earlier
turn need not fetch it again.
