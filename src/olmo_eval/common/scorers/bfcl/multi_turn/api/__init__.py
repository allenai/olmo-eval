"""Stateful API classes the BFCL multi-turn categories act on.

Vendored from the reference implementation, which is where the benchmark
defines them: an instance's attributes after a turn are what a prediction is
graded against, so a reimplementation would change the scores.

Each class simulates its domain in memory -- there is no file, network or
process access anywhere in them -- and is loaded from a test entry's
``initial_config`` before a rollout begins.

Source: https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla, berkeley-function-call-leaderboard,
``bfcl_eval/eval_checker/multi_turn_eval/func_source_code``. Only the imports
between these modules are rewritten; the bodies are untouched.
