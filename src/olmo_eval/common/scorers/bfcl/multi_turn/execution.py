"""Run BFCL multi-turn calls against the stateful API instances.

A turn is graded on what the calls did, so every call has to actually run. The
instances live for the length of one rollout: a call in a later turn sees the
state earlier calls left behind, which is most of what these categories
measure.

The reference implementation renders each call back to source and ``eval``s it
with the instances in ``globals()``, guarded by a list of function names it
refuses. Calls arrive here already decoded, as a name and its arguments, so
they are dispatched by looking the method up on the instance that defines it.
A model can then only reach methods the involved classes actually have, and
nothing it writes is executed as code.
