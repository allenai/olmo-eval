"""mm_olmo's "model prompt" (``_mp``) pointing prompts.

The ``_mp`` pointing datasets hand the model a bare ``label`` rather than a
pre-built question, and mm_olmo's ``DataFormatter`` turns that label into the
prompt. Two independent settings from the checkpoint's own config decide the
result:

``prompt_templates``
    ``"none"`` uses the lowercased label verbatim. ``"uber_model_v2"`` lowercases
    the label half the time and wraps it in one of :data:`POINTING_TEMPLATES`.

``system_prompt``
    ``"demo_or_style_v2"``/``"v3"`` add nothing. ``"style_and_length"``/``"_v2"``
    prefix the style name.

Template choice is seeded from the example's index in the dataset, so prompts are
reproducible but differ per example. Instruction-tuned checkpoints were trained on
the templated form and pretrain checkpoints on the terse prefixed form, so the
setting has to follow the checkpoint rather than the task.
