"""Suites for the CTC long-context family: one flag instead of 22 (or 177).

Two independent axes cut the suite, and the names keep them separate:

*Context length* -- how long the prompt is:

* ``ctc:figure``   -- every task at its 2k-32k ladder (the paper grid; 108 runs)
* ``ctc:xlong``    -- every task's rungs ABOVE 32k (64k-1M where built; 69 runs)
* ``ctc:r32k`` ... -- every task that has that rung, at that rung (one context-length column)

*Corpus-tracking demand* -- how much of the corpus must be held at once, the axis the suite is
named for (see :class:`olmo_eval.evals.tasks.ctc_suite.CTCClass`):

* ``ctc:low``      -- the 11 O(N) rows: an answer-bearing document exists and retrieval finds it
* ``ctc:high``     -- the 11 O(N^2)/O(NM)/O(N^3) rows: the answer is a relation over documents

The two axes compose, so the length-restricted forms are registered as well -- ``ctc:low:figure``,
``ctc:high:figure``, ``ctc:low:xlong``, ``ctc:high:xlong``. ``ctc:high:figure`` is the cheap
diagnostic worth reaching for first: it is where a long-context model that merely retrieves well
separates from one that actually tracks a corpus, at grid-sized cost.

And the rest:

* ``ctc:nq`` ...   -- one task's full ladder, every rung (one row)
* ``ctc``          -- everything (177 runs; know what you are asking for)

Aggregation is DISPLAY_ONLY throughout, including for ``ctc:low``/``ctc:high``: the tasks carry
heterogeneous metrics (f1, pair f1, kendall tau, ce_pos_recall, partial credit), and averaging
those into one number would be exactly the kind of quiet nonsense the per-task metric declarations
exist to prevent. A low-vs-high *comparison* is read per task, or as a gap on a shared metric --
never as one mean against another.
