"""Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard suites.

The suites reproduce the leaderboard's own summaries for the single-turn
categories. Two kinds of averaging are involved, and BFCL uses them in
different places:

- Its non-live summaries average the categories as equals, which the suites
  below express with ``AVERAGE`` and ``AVERAGE_OF_AVERAGES``.
- Its live summaries weight each category by how many instances it holds. A
  suite cannot express that, so the weighted summaries are tasks that pool
  their categories' instances — ``bfcl_live_ast`` and ``bfcl_live`` — which
  gives the same number.

The executable and REST categories are not implemented, so ``bfcl:non_live``
here is BFCL's non-live overall with those terms left out, and ``bfcl`` is its
single-turn overall on the same footing. Both differ from a published non-live
number, which averages the executable categories in.
