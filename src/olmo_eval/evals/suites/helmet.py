"""HELMET-plus task suites organized by category and context size.

Mirrors the suite structure in `suites/ruler.py`:
- Per-category suites for each size: helmet_recall__262144, helmet_icl__4096, etc.
- Combined suites for each size: helmet_all__4096, etc.
- A judge-free execution split: helmet_nojudge__4096, etc.

Three deliberate differences from `suites/ruler.py`:

1. `helmet_all__*` aggregates the *category* suites rather than flat-averaging
   every task, matching how the HELMET paper reports an overall number. A flat
   average would let a category's task count set its weight -- ICL contributes
   five tasks and rerank one, so rerank would be worth a fifth of ICL.

2. `helmet_all__*` is only registered where more than one category exists at
   that length. Above 128k only recall extends, so a combined suite there
   would be a rename of `helmet_recall__*` whose composition silently differs
   from the same suite at shorter lengths -- exactly the thing that turns a
   length sweep into a misleading trend line. Use `helmet_recall__*` for the
   extended tiers.

3. Some HELMET tasks are graded by an LLM judge (`narrativeqa` and both
   summarization tasks), so running them needs a judge configured. Following
   the execution-oriented split in `suites/science.py`, `helmet_all__*` is the
   umbrella that includes them and `helmet_nojudge__*` is the subset that runs
   without one.

HELMET's recall category is `json_kv` plus three RULER synthetic tasks
(`niah_mk_2`, `niah_mk_3`, `niah_mv`). Those three are implemented in the
`ruler_plus` task family, which covers the same 4k-2m sweep, so the recall
suites pull them in by their `ruler_plus_*` names rather than duplicating
them under a `helmet_` prefix.
