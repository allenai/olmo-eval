"""DeepSearchQA graded with the official paper prompt (Google DeepMind, arXiv 2601.20975).

This is a second implementation of the ``deepsearchqa`` task (see
``deepsearchqa.py`` for the dataset, taxonomy, and background) that instead
mirrors the grading methodology published in Appendix A of the technical
report: the judge grades the model's raw, free-form response directly rather
than a discrete ``FINAL ANSWER: ...`` line, and reports per-gold-item
"Correctness Details" plus a free-form "Excessive Answers" list rather than
matching two pre-extracted item lists by index.

Concretely, this changes two things relative to ``deepsearchqa``:
  * The generation prompt does not ask for a ``FINAL ANSWER:`` line; the full
    response is what gets judged.
  * The judge prompt and parsing follow the official schema: a boolean per
    expected gold item (did the response contain it), plus a free list of
    excessive items the response claimed that are not part of the gold
    answer. Precision/recall/F1/exact-match are derived from those counts
    the same way the paper defines them.

As with ``deepsearchqa``, the official grader is Gemini 2.5 Flash;
``build_openai_judge_fn`` is OpenAI-only, so this task uses an OpenAI model
against the official prompt text instead, and absolute numbers are still not
directly comparable to the public Kaggle leaderboard.

Usage:
    olmo-eval run -m llama3.1-8b -t deepsearchqa_official_judge --harness dr_tulu
    olmo-eval run -m llama3.1-8b -t deepsearchqa_official_judge:mini --harness dr_tulu

DEEPSEARCHQA_OFFICIAL_JUDGE_PROMPT = """\
Your task is to evaluate whether a given "AI Response" for a specific "User Prompt"
arrived at the correct answer.

**Answer Correctness Task**
* **Purpose:** Assess whether the AI response provides the correct answer(s) based on
the provided "Correct Answer" and "Prompt Type".
* **Process:**
    * Identify the "Prompt Type": "{prompt_type}".
    * Refer to the "Correct Answer": "{answer}".
    * Based on the "Prompt Type", determine if the "AI Response" contains the expected
answer(s).
        * **'Single Answer'**: Check if the response provides the answer that addresses
the user's question. It does not have to match the exact wording of the provided
answer.
        * **'Set Answer'**: Check if the response includes *each* item from the provided
ground truth answers. The order might not matter unless specified otherwise. The
response might include more answers than the list. Determine the correctness *
only* based on the list first and then check if the response includes answers not
in the list.
    * **Explanation:** Provide a brief explanation justifying your assessment of answer
correctness, referencing specific parts of the AI response and the correct answer.
    * **Correctness Details:** Provide a dictionary, one key for each expected answer
part, and value is a boolean indicating whether each expected answer part was found.
        * For 'Set Answer', this will be a list of attributes, one for each item/part in
the "Correct Answer". Each key will be a string indicating the expected answer
part, and the value will be a boolean indicating whether that part was found in
the response.
    * **Excessive Answers:** Provide a list of strings, each indicating an excessive
answer part. If the response provides answers that are **not** in the "Correct Answer
" list, add these answers as excessive answers. Return an empty list when there's no
excessive answers in the response.

**Output Format:**
Your evaluation *must* be structured as a nested JSON dictionary with the following top-
level keys: `"Answer Correctness"`. Please return NULL if any of "Prompt", "AI Response"
or "Correct Answer" is empty.
The value for `"Answer Correctness"` should be a dictionary containing `"Explanation"` (
a string), `"Correctness Details"` (a dictionary where each key is the expected correct
answer, and the value is a boolean indicating whether the response contains the correct
answer), and `"Excessive Answers"` (a list of strings indicating the excessive answers).

Make sure you return a valid JSON string. Pay special attention to quotes, commas and
special characters in the JSON string. Make sure to escape all special characters and
quotes in the JSON string.
