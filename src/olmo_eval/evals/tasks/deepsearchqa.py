"""DeepSearchQA: deep-research agent evaluation (Google DeepMind, arXiv 2601.20975).

DeepSearchQA is a 900-problem benchmark of hand-crafted, multi-step
information-seeking questions spanning 17 domains (Politics, Finance, Science,
Health, History, Geography, Media, ...). Each problem is either a
``Single Answer`` (one entity/value) or a ``Set Answer`` (an enumeration or
composite answer with multiple required items); on HuggingFace both are
stored as one comma-joined ``answer`` string
(``google/deepsearchqa``, config ``deepsearchqa``, split ``eval``). A handful
of ``Set Answer`` rows encode "no items satisfy every constraint" as the
literal text ``None``, which HuggingFace's CSV loader turns into a null; these
are scored as an empty gold answer set rather than dropped.

Grading follows the paper's outcome-based, set-comparison methodology: an
LLM judge decides, per item, whether a submitted answer is semantically
equivalent to a ground-truth answer (and vice versa), and the task reports
Precision (``|S ∩ G| / |S|``), Recall (``|S ∩ G| / |G|``), their harmonic
mean F1 (the primary metric), and an all-or-nothing Exact Match rate. The
official grader (Gemini 2.5 Flash, zero-shot) and its exact prompt *are*
published, in Appendix A of the technical report. This task nonetheless uses
an independently written judge prompt against olmo-eval's OpenAI-based judge
infrastructure (``build_openai_judge_fn`` is OpenAI-only), so absolute
numbers are not directly comparable to the public leaderboard: the official
prompt grades the model's raw free-form response directly, while this task
requires a discrete ``FINAL ANSWER: ...`` line and matches two pre-extracted
item lists by index. See ``deepsearchqa_official_judge`` for a second task
that instead mirrors the official prompt and grading mechanic. Set
``OLMO_EVAL_JUDGE=<model>[:<effort>]`` to change the judge model.

The task asks the model to end its response with a ``FINAL ANSWER: ...`` line
listing every item in its answer set, comma-separated; this line (rather than
the full response) is what gets judged. This benchmark is about finding
information via search rather than about knowledge already in the model's
parameters, so it is intended to be run with search tools attached via the
Harness abstraction (e.g. ``--harness dr_tulu``); running without tools mostly
measures parametric recall on questions designed to require live search.

Usage:
    # Tool-augmented (intended way to run this benchmark)
    olmo-eval run -m llama3.1-8b -t deepsearchqa --harness dr_tulu

    # Baseline, no search tools (for reference only)
    olmo-eval run -m llama3.1-8b -t deepsearchqa

    # Quick iteration on a 50-instance subset
    olmo-eval run -m llama3.1-8b -t deepsearchqa:mini --harness dr_tulu
