"""FrontierScience expert-level scientific reasoning (arXiv 2601.21165).

Two tracks from the open-sourced gold set of ``openai/frontierscience``:

``frontierscience_olympiad``
    100 short-answer olympiad problems (IPhO / IChO / IBO level). A model judge
    compares the attempted answer against the reference answer and returns a
    CORRECT / INCORRECT verdict, so the primary metric is accuracy.

``frontierscience_research``
    60 open-ended PhD-level research sub-tasks. Each carries a rubric totaling
    10 points that credits intermediate derivations as well as the final result.
    A model judge tallies the points earned; the paper marks a response a
    success at seven or more points, which is the primary metric here. The mean
    fraction of rubric points earned is reported alongside it because it is the
    more sensitive signal on a benchmark where frontier models score around 25%.

Both tracks report the primary metric overall and per subject (biology,
chemistry, physics).

The problem statements already end with the benchmark's own answer-format
instruction, so the generation prompt is the ``problem`` field verbatim with
nothing prepended. Olympiad responses are cut down to the text after the final
``FINAL ANSWER`` marker the dataset asks for; research responses are graded
whole, since the rubric credits the derivation.

Judge prompts are reconstructed from the paper's Appendix B listings, including
its ``attemped`` typo. The paper typesets one example as math, so the exact
characters behind ``6.69 ~ 6.7`` are unrecoverable; the rendered form is used.

The paper judges with GPT-5 at high reasoning effort. The deliberate project
default is the dated ``gpt-5.5-2026-04-23:high`` snapshot; set
``OLMO_EVAL_JUDGE=gpt-5:high`` to reproduce the published numbers, or a cheaper
spec such as ``gpt-5-mini`` for iteration. The resolved judge configuration is
serialized with the task because judge strictness moves these scores.

The paper averages Olympiad over 20 independent trials and Research over 30. The
``:paper`` variants request that many samples per problem, and per-instance
scores are the mean over samples rather than the harness default of the max.
