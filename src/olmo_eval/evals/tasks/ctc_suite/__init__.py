"""
The CTC (corpus-tracking-capacity) long-context suite: 22 tasks, context ladders from 2k to 1M
tokens.

Each task gives the model a corpus of N documents in-prompt and asks a question whose difficulty
scales with how much of the corpus must be *simultaneously* tracked -- from O(N) retrieval (find
the answer-bearing passage) to O(N^2) relational tasks (find every contradicting pair) and O(NM)
structural ones (cluster everything). Every task has a ladder of context rungs; a rung label is the
measured median prompt length through the reference prompt path, not a document count.

**Provenance.** Prompt templates, answer parsers, per-task metrics, gold-index conventions and stop
rules are vendored verbatim from the ``ctc`` package (AI2 OLMo-core branch ``prasann/ctc``, commit
:data:`UPSTREAM_COMMIT`) under ``_vendor/``, where they are golden-fixture-tested against the
pre-migration implementation. That implementation produced the suite's published numbers, but four
rows have been re-graded since -- the README's "Grading changed after the published grid" table
says which, and an old number for one of those rows came from the old grader. Do not edit the
vendored files here; fix upstream and re-vendor. Only the subtrees this harness actually calls are
vendored
-- see ``_vendor/MANIFEST.md`` for what was taken and what was deliberately left behind. One spec
(plain ``grouping``) is registered locally below from the vendored factory.

**Data.** Public HF dataset ``PrasannSinghal/ctc-suite-eval``, pinned at :data:`HF_REVISION`: one
config per task, one split per rung (``r2k`` ... ``r1m``). The pin is part of the task config and
therefore part of the task hash, so a dataset rebuild shows up as a new hash instead of silently
changing what an old number meant. Set ``CTC_SUITE_DATA_ROOT=/path/to/ladders`` to read local
``<task>/rung_<tokens>.jsonl`` files instead (same files the HF dataset is built from); the local
path *replaces* the config's data source, so a run over an unvalidated local ladder also gets its
own task hash rather than being stored under the published data's.

**Comparability notes.**

* Rungs at 256k and above carry ``eval_size=125`` (seeded subsample of the same question set;
  binomial SE ~ +/-0.041 at f1~0.7) -- quote the size next to any number from them. ``scifact``
  is 300 examples and ``obliq_twitter`` 123-126 at every rung; same rule. Every rung whose size is
  not the 500-example default is recorded in :attr:`RosterRow.eval_size`.
* Prompts here are the plain-text prompt path (``spec.build_prompt``). The original suite's
  vLLM/native runs additionally wrapped each document in Qwen-reserved marker tokens at
  tokenization time; scores are therefore comparable *within* this harness, and near but not
  bit-identical to the historical grid.
* ``query_position`` is pinned to ``"both"`` -- the setting every published rung was graded with.
* **Reasoning models.** A generation whose ``<think>`` block is never closed is counted as a parse
  failure rather than being handed to the parser: the ids inside an unfinished trace are the ones
  the model was *considering*, and scoring them credits a model for thinking out loud. Give such a
  model room to finish instead, by overriding the decode budget (see
  :meth:`CTCSuiteTask.get_sampling_params`); the suite's own budgets are sized for a direct answer.
